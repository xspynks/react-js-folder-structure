This git repository contains the proof of concept for a touring helper app using ReactJS.

The proposed folder structure is based on principles of Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture, and is organized around the core business logic and user interface of the app.

The structure promotes modularity and separation of concerns, and is easy to navigate and understand for developers working on the project.

An example of using atoms, layouts, molecules, and organisms is included in the shared components folder.
